# DMComm

Second attempt at Arduino library to communicate with Digimon toys, by BladeSabre ( bladethecoder@gmail.com ). License: MIT.

For the working version which is not a library, see https://github.com/dmcomm/dmcomm-project .

For the CircuitPython version for RP2040, see https://github.com/dmcomm/dmcomm-python .

Intending to structure it similarly to `dmcomm-python` this time around.
