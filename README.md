# DMComm

Second attempt at Arduino library to communicate with Digimon toys, by BladeSabre ( bladethecoder@gmail.com ). License: MIT.

Loosely based on `dmcomm-python`, but avoiding dynamic allocation (except in SerialFollower).

Clone the repo into your Arduino libraries directory, then open the ClassicComUnit example.

Other variants:
* For the fully-working version which is not a library, see https://github.com/dmcomm/dmcomm-project
* For the CircuitPython version for RP2040, see https://github.com/dmcomm/dmcomm-python
